    <font size="5"><p>Steeped in religious mythology, legends and heritage, Uttarakhand is home to a number of revered temples, holy rivers and spiritual sites. Devotees flock to here for pilgrimages to Char Dham (four religious centres namely Kedarnath, Badrinath, Yamunotri and Gangotri) and to Panch Prayag, the confluence of rivers in five sites that ultimately form River Ganga, one of India’s most sacred rivers and worshipped as a goddess, along with visits to several other destinations of religious importance (like Bageshwar, Joshimath, Baijnath to name a few) in the state that is also referred to as the land of pilgrims.</font></p>
    <hr><pre><h3><font size="10">i- Badrinath</font></h3></pre>
    <font size="5"><p>The Badrinath Temple also known as the Badrinarayan Temple, located in Uttarakhand's Badrinath town, is one of the Char Dhams (four important pilgrimages) in the state. There are four pilgrim-destinations namely Yamunotri, Gangotri, Kedarnath, and Badrinath, collectively known as Char Dham. These pilgrimage centres draw large number of pilgrims each year, thus becoming the most important hubs of religious travel in the whole of Northern India. 

        Badrinath is located at an elevation of around 3,100 m. Located in the Garhwal Himalayas, on the banks of the Alaknanda river, this sacred town lies between Nar and Narayana mountain ranges. The temple is believed to have been established by sage Adi Shankaracharya in the 8th century. With Lord Vishnu as its presiding deity, the temple remains open for six months in a year. In winter it becomes inaccessible due to heavy snowfall. </p></font>
        <pre><h3><font size="6">BEST TIME TO VISIT</font></h3></pre>
        <font size="5"><p>The ideal time to visit Badrinath Temple is from May to October. The temple is closed from October/ November, and is reopened around April.</p></font><hr>
        <pre><h3><font size="10">ii- Baijnath</font></h3></pre>
        <font size="5"><p>Nestled deep inside the Garur valley, Baijnath is a small but ancient town that was the capital of the erstwhile Katyuri dynasty. Remnants of that era can be seen even today in the temples located on the banks of the Gomti river. The main temple, from which Baijnath takes its name, is a 12th century Lord Shiva shrine, which is the most popular attraction of this town. The temple has several legends attached to it. The temple complex with exquisite architecture is a monument protected by the Archaeological Survey of India. Baijnath is one of the four places connected by the 'Shiva Heritage Circuit' in Kumaon. Surrounded by lush forests and fruit orchards, Baijnath offers exceptional nature trails and a wonderful opportunity to spot rare species of birds, butterflies and flowers.</p></font>
        <pre><h3><font size="6">BEST TIME TO VISIT</font></h3></pre>
        <font size="5"><p>The summer season (April-June) is the best time to visit Baijnath. But if you travel in winter (October-March) you can enjoy snowfall.</p></font><hr>
        <pre><h3><font size="10">iii- Jageshwar</font></h3></pre>
        <font size="5"><p>A serene temple town located in the Almora district of Uttarakhand, Jageshwar is a cluster of more than 100 stone temples, dedicated to Lord Shiva, which have inspired its popular name, “Valley of Gods”. Some small, while others very prominent, the temples reflect the finest architecture and are set against a backdrop of verdant mountains and the sparkling Jat Ganga stream. A heritage site protected under the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), the temple complex has around 125 temples and around 174 sculptures, including idols of Lord Shiva and Parvati. Over 25 inscriptions have been found on the walls and pillars of some of these temples. According to the ASI, the temples are estimated to be about 2,500 years old and belong to the post-Gupta and pre-medieval eras. They were mostly built and renovated by the Katyuri dynasty kings. In recent years, a red sandstone pillar has also been discovered here with engraved figures of humans and spiritual figures. The pillar is said to be built in 1st century BC. Jageshwar draws crowds during the Jageshwar Monsoon Festival, in the month of August, and during the Shivratri Mela, in spring.</p></font>

        <pre><h3><font size="10">iv- Devprayag</font></h3></pre>
        <font size="5"><p>A beautiful showcase of traditions, myths and mysticism, Devprayag is the place where the holy rivers Bhagirathi and Alaknanda meet, merge into one and take the name Ganga, making it a unique pilgrimage. It is believed that Lord Rama and his father King Dasharath (from the epic Ramayana) performed penance here. The main temple of the town is Raghunathji Temple and is dedicated to Lord Rama. Devprayag is one of the Panch Prayag or five sacred confluences of the Alaknanda river. The rivers converge to flow down to the plains as River Ganga. The five holy sites are Vishnuprayag, Nandaprayag, Karnaprayag, Rudraprayag and Devprayag. The town is also the winter seat for the priests of Badrinath Dham temple. Located on the route for Chardham yatra, Devprayag attracts thousands of devotees, especially during the yatra season.</p></font>
        <pre><h3><font size="6">BEST TIME TO VISIT</font></h3></pre>
        <font size="5"><p>Devprayag is an all-time favourite destination among explorers. Summers are pleasant with ample amount of sunshine. The winters are quite cold and freezing. Monsoons are pleasant too.</p></font>

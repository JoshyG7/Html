          <font size="5"><p>Ladakh, large area of the northern and eastern Kashmir region, northwestern Indian subcontinent. Administratively, Ladakh is divided between Pakistan (northwest), as part of Gilgit-Baltistan, and India (southeast), as part of Ladakh union territory (until October 31, 2019, part of Jammu and Kashmir state); in addition, China administers portions of northeastern Ladakh. </p><p>Ladakh covers about 45,000 square miles (117,000 square km) and contains the Ladakh Range, which is a southeastern extension of the Karakoram Range, and the upper Indus River valley. Ladakh is one of the highest regions of the world. Its natural features consist mainly of high plains and deep valleys. The high plain predominates in the east, diminishing gradually toward the west. In southeastern Ladakh lies Rupshu, an area of large, brackish lakes with a uniform elevation of about 13,500 feet (4,100 metres). To the northwest of Rupshu lies the Zaskar Range, an inaccessible region where the people and the cattle remain indoors for much of the year because of the cold. Zaskar is drained by the Zaskar River, which, flowing northward, joins the Indus River below Leh. In the heart of Ladakh, farther to the north, cultivation by means of manuring and irrigation is practiced by farmers living in valley villages at elevations between about 9,000 and 15,000 feet (2,750 and 4,550 metres). Shepherds tend flocks in the upland valleys that are too high for cultivation. Leh, the most accessible town of Ladakh, is an important trade centre located 160 miles (260 km) east of Srinagar.</p></font>

          <h1><font size="6">The Great Himalayas</font></h1>
          <font size="5"><p>The northernmost Great, or Higher, Himalayas (in ancient times, the Himadri), with crests generally above 16,000 feet (4,900 metres) in elevation, are composed of ancient crystalline rocks and old marine sedimentary formations. Between the Great and Lesser Himalayas are several fertile longitudinal vales; in India the largest is the Vale of Kashmir, an ancient lake basin with an area of about 1,700 square miles (4,400 square km). The Great Himalayas, ranging from 30 to 45 miles (50 to 75 km) wide, include some of the world’s highest peaks. The highest in the range, Mount Everest (at 29,035 feet [8,850 metres]; see Researcher’s Note: Height of Mount Everest), is on the China-Nepal border, but India also has many lofty peaks. Notable among those is Kanchenjunga (28,169 feet [8,586 metres]) on the border of Nepal and the state of Sikkim, which is the world’s third tallest peak and India’s highest point. Other high mountains in India include Nanda Devi (25,646 feet [7,817 metres]), Kamet (25,446 feet [7,755 metres]), and Trisul (23,359 feet [7,120]) in Uttarakhand. The Great Himalayas lie mostly above the line of perpetual snow and thus contain most of the Himalayan glaciers.</p></font>

          <h1><font size="6">Associated ranges and hills</font></h1>
          <font size="5"><p>In general, the various regional ranges and hills run parallel to the Himalayas’ main axis. Those are especially prominent in the northwest, where the Zaskar Range and the Ladakh and Karakoram ranges (all in India-administered Kashmir) run to the northeast of the Great Himalayas. Also in the Kashmir region is the Pir Panjal Range, which, extending along the southwest of the Great Himalayas, forms the western and southern flanks of the Vale of Kashmir.</p><p>At its eastern extremity, the Himalayas give way to a number of smaller ranges running northeast-southwest—including the heavily forested Patkai Range and the Naga and Mizo hills—which extend along India’s borders with Myanmar and the southeastern panhandle of Bangladesh. Within the Naga Hills, the reedy Logtak Lake, in the Manipur River valley, is an important feature. Branching off from those hills to the northwest are the Mikir Hills, and to the west are the Jaintia, Khasi, and Garo hills, which run just north of India’s border with Bangladesh. Collectively, the latter group is also designated as the Shillong (Meghalaya) Plateau.</p></font>

          <h1><font size="6">The History of Ladakh Before the 9th Century</font></h1>
          <font size="5"><p>The earliest population of Ladakh has been asserted to be that of Dards or Brokpas. Many ancient accounts by the Greek historians, Herodotus and Megasthenes, and the admiral of Alexander the Great, Nearchus have confirmed the existence of the Brokpas (Dards) in Ladakh. An interesting fact tells that Herodotus also mentioned the gold-digging ants of central Asia, which is also mentioned in connection with the Dardi people of Ladakh by Nearchus. The Kharoshti inscription discovered near Khalatse Bridge tells that Ladakh in the 1st Century was under the rule of the Kushan Empire.</p></font>

          <h1><font size="6">The Formation of Ladakh Kingdom and the Inhabitation of Tibetans</font></h1>
          <font size="5"><p>Nyima-Gon, a representative of the ancient Tibetan royal house founded the first Ladakh dynasty after the breakup of the Tibetan Empire in 842 CE. From this time, the Tibetan population started to cohabit with the Brokpas. So, the total population of Ladakh wasn’t only made of Brokpas but also the Tibetan people. During this era, Buddhism and Tibetan religion of Bon were also spread across the region. An early king, Lde-dpal-hkhor-btsan (c. 870 -900) was responsible for the construction of several monasteries in Ladakh, including the Upper Manahris Monastery.</p></font>

          <h1><font size="6">About Sengge Namgyal</font></h1>
          <font size="5"><p>During the reign of Sengge Namgyal, who was known as the Lion King, constructions in Ladakh were in full swing. He commissioned the construction of many monasteries in Ladakh including the popular Hemis Monastery. Sengge Namgyal also ordered the construction of the Leh Palace and moved the headquarters of his kingdom from Shey Palace to this newly constructed one. Under Sengge, the kingdom further expanded to Zanskar and Spiti. He was later defeated by the Mughals who had already conquered Kashmir and Baltistan.</p></font>

          <h1><font size="6">About Deldan Namgyal and the Involvement of the Mughals</font></h1>
          <font size="5"><p>Deldan Namgyal, the successor of Sengge Namgyal had to make a treaty with the Mughals and as a symbol of it, he allowed Mughal Emperor, Aurangzeb to build a mosque in Leh. Later, with the help of the Mughal Army under Fidai Khan, Deldan Namgyal defeated the 5th Dalai Lama invasion in the plains of Chargyal, which is situated between Nimoo and Basgo.</p></font>
